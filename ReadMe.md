# Purpose of the project 
With students (including myself) losing steam at the later part of coursework, I set out to create a website that would display powerful and inspiring quotes while helping students carry on and press through the remainder of their coursework. Also, I hoped to give new perspectives with words from the greatest minds of the past and present.

# Target end-user for this program
The ideal end-user is one that is looking to gain a source of inspiration or have their perspective changed on how to approach life and their struggles. As such, I believe there is no IDEAL end-user as I believe all walks of life can and will benefit from this.
